# Bayesian Model Averaging in Quantile Regression for Inflation Forecasting

This open-source software provides a Bayesian model averaging (BMA) approach to quantile regression for inflation forecasting, inspired by Korobilis (2017). The Quantile Regression BMA (QR-BMA) model aims to address model uncertainty by allowing different predictors to influence various quantiles of inflation.

## Abstract
Based on Korobilis (2017), "Quantile regression forecasts of inflation under model uncertainty" (International Journal of Forecasting, 33(1), pp.11-20), this software demonstrates QR-BMA's effectiveness in predicting inflation, comparing favorably with traditional regression models and nonlinear specifications.

## Features
- Bayesian model averaging (BMA) implementation in a quantile regression framework.
- Flexible model that allows different predictors across quantiles.
- Calibration and performance metrics aligned with QR-BMA approaches.
